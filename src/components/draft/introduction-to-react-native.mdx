# ⚛️ Intro to React Native

---

## 🤷‍♀️ What is it

[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) lets you create apps for:

- Android
- iOS
- Web (bonus ! 🤩)

---

## 👷‍♂️ Who Created it

Facebook

---

## 💻 Who is using it

- Airbnb
- Tesla
- Facebook
- Instagram
- Discord
- and more…

---

### 👩‍🏫 The principle

"Learn once, write anywhere."

Share principles, not codebase.

---

### ⚛️ What is React Native

- Built using React
- Build cross patform apps using JavaScript
- Target not only iOS & Android, but also Apple TV, VR, AR, Windows, & Desktop
- Real world projects typically see 80%-95% code reuse

---

### Why React Native

- Fast development speed
- Low development cost
  - Code reuse
  - Easier to find developpers
- Ship across multiple platforms
- Over-the-Air updates

---

### How React Native works

- JavaScript is bundled and minified using Babel (built-in)
- Separate threads for UI, Layout, and JavaScript
- Threads communicate asynchronously through native bridge

---

<img src={rn} style='width:auto; height:100%' />

---

### UI Primitives

tldr; A shit load.

You just need to import them.

```javascript
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'
```

---

### UI Primitives mapping (Web)

- View == div
- Text == span
- ScrollView == styled div
- Image == img
- TextInput == input
- …

---

### Device API's

- CameraRoll
- Keyboard
- NetInfo
- Vibration
- …

---

### React Native vs Web

- Different primitives
- Styling (but similar)
- No browser APIs (almost none)
- Navigation
- Native IDEs / configuration
- Deployment

---

### React Native vs Web

#### Event handling

- Not all same interactions
- Different types of Touchable Components
  - Button (higher level)
  - TouchableOpacity, TouchableHighlight… (lower level)
- Customizable from scratch touchable with PanResponder

---

### React Native vs Web

#### Styling

- CSS based
- Layout with CSS Flexbox
- Opmized with StyledSheet
  - Refer to styles by ID instead of creating new style object everytime
  - Send styles only once through the bridge

---

### 💥 Extend your tooling

Use [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/)

---

### 🤷‍♀️ What is Expo

- Framework and a platform for universal RN apps.
- Brings a set of tools built around RN and native platforms
- Helps us to:
  - Develop
  - Build
  - Deploy
  - Quickly

---

### 🤷‍♀️ What is Expo

tldr; Expo pushes to realize the “Write once, run anywhere” dream

- Avoid touching native code, just write React
- No need for configuration when using lower level APIs
- Gives an abstraction around specic platform behaviours

---

### 🧰 Setup

- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) or `nvm` (recommended)
- Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any other editor
- Create your app with [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v36.0.0/get-started/create-a-new-app/)
- You're ready to go!

```bash
expo init MyApp
```

---

### 🗂 Project Structure

- `node_modules/`: dependencies
- `assets/`: app icon, splash screen, images...
- `App.jsx`: entry point
- `app.json`: configuration
- `package.json`: dependencies listing, and more configs

---

### 🥋 React vs React Native

It's Web vs Native

---

## ⚛️ React

- **Style & Layout**: HTML, CSS
- **Logic**: JavaScript with React.js

---

## ⚛️📱 React Native

- **Style & Layout**: Native Platform mapped to their target platform equivalent
  - View: Android `View` & iOS `UIView`
  - Text: Android `TextView` & iOS `UITextField`
  - …etc…
- **Logic**: JavaScript with React.js

---

### 💅 Layout & Style

- [Style](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/react-native/style/)
- Layout with [CSS Flexbox](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/react-native/flexbox/)
  - Columns
  - Rows

---

### 📱Components

- [Icons](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v36.0.0/guides/icons/)
- [Handling TextInput](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/react-native/handling-text-input/)
- [Handling Touches](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/react-native/handling-touches/)
- [ScrollView](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/react-native/using-a-scrollview/)
- [ListView](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/react-native/using-a-listview/)
- [Networking](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/react-native/network/)
- [Navigation with React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/): third party library

---

### ✅ The Goods (part 1)

- Target multiple platforms
- Single code base
  - Develop the app once
- Deploy it
  - Google Playstore (Android)
  - Apple Store (iOS)
  - Target the Web (but it’s in Alpha)

---

## ✅ The Goods (part 2)

- JS Programming Language
  - Very approachable
  - C style language
- Built-in Components
  - Fast prototyping
  - Rapid iteration
- The community
  - Huge community
  - Many problems already solved by somebody

---

### In Brief

- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) lets you build Android and iOS with one Code Base,
- [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/) makes it easier to work with React Native
