## Functionalities

### Menu Screen

- List the available dishes
- I can select a dish, which will add it to my shopping cart

#### Dish

A dish should have at least the following properties - Name - Description - Price - Allergens
Feel free to add any information that you think will be helpful.

### Dish Details Screen

Should show the details of a Dish in one Screen, or a Modal.

### Shopping Cart Screen

- Lists all selected Dishes
- The user can unselect a Dish, which will remove it from the screen

### Success Screen

- Simple success screen to tell the user that everything went fine

## Backend

Backend team and frontend team can sometimes be non synchronous,
so to build your part and overcome this non synchronicity:

Just **Mock** your data.

## Bonus

- Persist your data, with Localstorage, Asyncstorage‚Ä¶whatever. - I just want to be able to leave the app and come back and see that my selection is still there
