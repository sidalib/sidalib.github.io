#### Functionalities

###### Menu Screen

- List the available dishes
- I can select a dish, which will add it to my shopping cart

######## Dish

A dish should have at least the following properties - Name - Description - Price - Allergens
Feel free to add any information that you think will be helpful.

###### Dish Details Screen

Should show the details of a Dish in one Screen, or a Modal.

###### Shopping Cart Screen

- Lists all selected Dishes
- The user can unselect a Dish, which will remove it from the screen

###### Success Screen

- Simple success screen to tell the user that everything went fine

#### Backend

Backend team and frontend team can sometimes be non synchronous,
so to build your part and overcome this non synchronicity:

Just **Mock** your data.

#### Bonus

If you already finished and just wan't to have fun:

- Persist your data with: Localstorage, Asyncstorage, Firebase, Contentful, whatever
- I just want to be able to leave the app and come back and see that my selection is still there
