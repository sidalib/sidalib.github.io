# ⚛️Intro to React Native

---

## 🤷‍♀️ What is it

[React](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) lets you create native apps for:

- Android
- iOS
- Even Web

---

## 👷‍♂️ Who Created it

Facebook

---

## 💻 Who is using it

- Airbnb
- Tesla
- Facebook
- Instagram
- Wallmart
- Discord

---

### 👩‍🏫 The principle

"Learn once, write anywhere."

Instead of sharing the same codebase, you share the same principles

---

### 💥 Extend you tooling

Use [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/)

### 🤷‍♀️ What is Expo

- Framework and a platform for universal React applications
- Brings a set of tools built around React Native and native platforms
  - Helps you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate

---

### 🤷‍♀️ What is Expo

- Expo pushes to realize the “Write once, run anywhere” dream
- Avoid touching native code, just write React
- No need for configuration when using lower level APIs
- Gives an abstraction around specic platform behaviours

---

### 🧰 Setup

- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any other editor
- Create your app with [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v36.0.0/get-started/create-a-new-app/)
- You're ready to go!

```bash
expo init MyApp
```

---

### 🗂 Project Structure

- `node_modules/`: dependencies
- `assets/`: app icon, splash screen, images...
- `App.jsx`: entry point
- `app.json`: configuration
- `package.json`: dependencies listing, and more configs

---

### 🥋 React vs React Native

It's Web vs Native

---

## ⚛️ React

- **Style & Layout**: HTML, CSS
- **Logic**: JavaScript with React.js

---

## ⚛️📱 React Native

- **Style & Layout**: Native Platform mapped to their target platform equivalent
  - View: Android `View` & iOS `UIView`
  - Text: Android `TextView` & iOS `UITextField`
  - ...
- **Logic**: JavaScript with React.js

---

### 💅 Layout & Style

- [Style](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/react-native/style/)
- Layout with [CSS Flexbox](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/react-native/flexbox/)
  - Columns
  - Rows

---

### 📱 Layout

Everything is a Component

- [Icons](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v36.0.0/guides/icons/)
- [Handling TextInput](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/react-native/handling-text-input/)
- [Handling Touches](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/react-native/handling-touches/)
- [ScrollView](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/react-native/using-a-scrollview/)
- [ListView](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/react-native/using-a-listview/)
- [Networking](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/react-native/network/)
- [Navigation with React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/): third party library

---

### ✅ The Goods (part 1)

- Target multiple platforms
- Single code base
  - Develop the app once
- Deploy it
  - Google Playstore (Android)
  - Apple Store (iOS)
  - Target the Web (but it’s in Alpha)

---

## ✅ The Goods (part 2)

- JS Programming Language
  - Very approachable
  - C style language
- Built-in Components
  - Fast prototyping
  - Rapid iteration
- The community
  - Huge community
  - Many problems already solved by somebody

---

### In Brief

- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) lets you build Android and iOS with one Code Base,
- [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/) makes it easier to work with React Native
