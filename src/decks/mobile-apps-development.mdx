### 👨‍🎓 UPHF

- Got my Master's Degree in 2019
- Thankful to be here and to teach you about what I know 🙏

---

### 🤷‍♀️ Why this course

- 💼 I want to Find a Job
- 💰 I want to launch a my own Startup

---

### 💰 I want to launch a Startup

I've got this wonderful idea about an app that will change the face of the world,here is my todo list:

- ✅ Pitch
- ✅ Mockups
- ✅ Conception
- ❌ Development

---

### 🛠 Which tool should I use

- Platform Specific
- Cross Platform

---

### 👉 Platform Specific

- Android: Kotlin & Java
- iOS: Swift & SwiftUI

**So, I want to have two apps, then I must write one per platform ? 😭**

---

## 🙅‍♂️ Nope

I don't have time to do that.
Let's find out a more pragmatic solution ! 💡

---

## And the solution is...

---

### 🪐 Cross Platform

- **Native**

  - Flutter
  - React Native

- **Hybrid**

  - Ionic

---

### 🤷‍♀️ Why a Cross platform framework

1 code = Android + iOS + Web 🎉

---

### So...

- No need to write multiple apps 📱
- It will cost less time and money ⏳💵

---

### Summary

React Native, Flutter, Ionic ...etc... came to save us 🎉.

- Single UI Team
- Less time coding
- Less time maintaining code
- Less monies spending

<!-- React BEGIN-->

# ⚛️ React Native

---

## 🤷‍♀️ What is it

[React](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) lets you create native apps for Android and iOS using React.

---

## 👷‍♂️ Who Created it

Facebook

---

## 💻 Who is using it

- Airbnb
- Tesla
- Facebook
- Instagram
- Wallmart
- Discord

---

### 👩‍🏫 The principle

"Learn once, write anywhere."

Instead of sharing the same codebase, you share the same principles

---

### 💥 Extend you tooling

Use [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/)

### 🤷‍♀️ What is Expo

Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications.
It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.

---

### 🤷‍♀️ What is Expo

- Expo came to save us it’s evolving to support the “Write once, run anywhere”
- Avoid touching any native code Just write React
- I wan’t to add Geoloc and stuff Need to deal with native platforms Android Studion XCdode
- It gives an abstraction around specic platform behaviours

React Native Team & Expo Team are Very close💞

---

### 🧰 Setup

- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any other editor, but trust me, VSCode is dope ! 💪
- Create an App with [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v36.0.0/get-started/create-a-new-app/)
- You're ready to go!

---

### 🗂 Project Structure

- `node_modules/`: all dependecies reside here
- `assets/`: app icon, splash screen, images, fonts
- `App.jsx`: app entry point
- `app.json`: app configuration, no need to deal with Android Studio and XCode to edit configs 🎉
- `package.json`: dependencies, and other configs

---

### 🥋 React vs React Native

It's Web vs Native

---

## ⚛️ React

- Style & Layout: HTML, CSS
- Logic: JavaScript with React.js

---

## ⚛️📱 React Native

- Style & Layout: Native Platform mapped to their target platform equivalent
  - View: Android `View` & iOS `UIView`
  - Text: Android `TextView` & iOS `UITextField`
  - ...
- Logic: JavaScript with React.js

---

### 💅 Style

- CSS Flexbox like syntax
  - Columns
  - Rows

### 📱 Layout

Everything is a Component

- (Icons](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v36.0.0/guides/icons/)
- Handling TextInput
- Handling Touches
- ScrollView
- ListView
- Networking
- Navigation: third Party: https://reactnavigation.org/

---

### ✅ The Goods (part 1)

- Target multiple platforms
- Single code base
  - Develop the app once
- Deploy it
  - Google Playstore (Android) - Apple Store (iOS) - Target the Web (but it’s in Alpha)

---

## ✅ The Goods (part 2)

- JS Programming Language
  - Very approachable - C style language
- Built-in Components - Fast prototyping - Rapid iteration - Not so many third party dependencies
- The community - Huge community - Almost all your problems are already solved

---

### 1️⃣ In one sentence

React Native lets you build Android and iOS with one Code Base, and Expo makes it easier to work with React Native. 🪐⚛️

<!-- Flutter BEGIN-->

---

# 🐦 Flutter

---

## 🤷‍♀️ What is it

Flutter lets develop applications for Android and iOS, as well as being the primary method of creating applications for Google Fuchsia.

---

## 👷‍♂️ Who Created it

Google

---

## 👷‍♂️ Who is using it

- Google Assistant
- Google Ads
- Alibaba Group
- The New York Times
- Square

---

## 👩‍🏫 The principle

Same as React Native, write once run anywhere.

---

### ✅ The Goods (part 1)

#### ⌨️ Developer Experience

- `Dart` programming language
  - Very approachable
  - `C` style language
  - Amazing developer tooling
  - Inline documentation
  - Catch errors before running the app
- Built-in Widgets
  - Fast prototyping
  - Rapid iteration
  - Not so many third party dependencies

---

### ✅ The Goods (part 2)

#### 🏎 Performance

- `60 FPS` to `120 FPS` Rendering
- Implements it’s own `C++` Engine
  - With the `Skia` Library
  - Gives a blanks canvas to render your own graphics, like a game engine
- Compilation
  - **Just in Time**: Good debugging
  - **Ahead of Time**: Performant

---

### ❌ The Tradeofs

- Small ecosystem
  - But, grows really fast 🚀
  - Difficult to find the right packages for your need
- Not all Specific platform APIs supported
  - Don’t use it if you have a lot of low level features to handle

---

### 🧰 Setup

Forllow the steps [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

- Download Flutter, and excract where you want
- Add it to environment path in order to access the `flutter` command anywhere
- Run `flutter doctor`
  - Not everything is required
  - I’m recommending to use **VSCode**, so we don't care if it complain about **Xcode** and **Android Studio**
- You first project
  - In your terminal: `flutter create AppName`

### ⌨️ VSCode Extensions

- Dart
- Flutter
- Awesome Flutter Snippets
- Android iOS Emulator
  - Makes it easier to switch between Emulated and Plugged In devices

---

### 🗂 Project Structure

- `android/` & `ios/`:

  - Configuraction: can be donne with Android Studio and XCode
  - Native build

- `test/`: your Unit & Integration tests
- `pubspec.yml`:
  - Lists dependencies, like `package.json` in the JS ecosystem
  - Registers static assets(images, etc...), included in the final bundle of the app

### 🟢 Run you App

- In **VSCode**: hit `F5` and here you go
- It will **Hot reload** on your changes
  - State of the app is preserved

---

### ⌨️ Everything is a Widget

Most of the widgets have at least one name argument.

- Just hover between paratheses to see what you can do it
  - Awesome `tab` programming

---

### ⌨️ Widgets: Stateful vs Stateless

---

### Stateful Widget

- Has in internal State than can be altered
  - `setState` to change it, like in **React**
- Has Lifecycle
  - `initState()`: called when added to the Widgets tree
  - `dispose()`: called when removed from the Widgets tree
- Implementation
  - State Class
  - Layout Class that extends the State Class

---

### Stateless Widget

- Immutable

  - No dynamic internal State
  - Lot of built-in mechanism to trigger UI reloads
  - Properties defined inside will never change

- Implementation

  - Implement a `build` Method, give it a `context` to say where it lives in the Widgets Tree

- Properties are defined inside the constructor
  - `key` is used to let flutter know the order and stuff

---

### 💅 Themes

- Material

  - Google : `import 'package:flutter/material.dart';`

- Cupertino

  - Apple: `import 'package:flutter/cupertino.dart';`

---

### 📱 Platform Specific

- `import 'dart:io' show Platform`;
- To determine the environment on which you're in
  - Display based on that manually

---

### 📱 Layout: SingleChild

- Built-In
  - `Center`
  - `Padding`
  - `Container`: does multiple things at same time

---

### 📱 Layout: Box Decoration

- Apply styles
  - Shadows
  - Gradients
  - Change the shape of a `Container` for example

---

### 📱 Layout: Text

- Text itself
- Style
  - TextStyle
  - Can use `Theme.of` to use theme of context
- Handle if text is too long and stuff

---

### 📱 Layout: Gestures and Buttons

- Interactions

  - Buttons
  - A lot of built-in Buttons

- GestureDetection

  - Boxes
  - Take a function that handles it
  - The lowest level of a button
  - Inkwell (Material) in between
  - wrapped around Material give a feeling of click

---

### 📱 Layout: Flex Layout

- Exactly like CSS Flexbox
  - Columns
  - Top to Bottom
  - Accepts an Array of children
  - Rows
  - Left to Right
  - Accepts an Array of children

---

### 📱 Layout: Stacks

- Overlapping Widgets
  - On top of each other

---

### 📱 Layout: Scrollable Views

- ListView
- ListView.build
  - For bigger content
- GridView
  - GrivView.count
  - Columns splitting

---

### 📱 Layout: AnimatedWidgets

---

### 📱 Layout: Themes

---

### 🛣 Navigation

- Stack
  - Push: forward
  - Pop: backward
- Use Navigator Class
- Can also use `PageView`
  - Easier

---

### ⌨️ Form & TextFormField

### ⏭ Async Widget

- Future
  - One Event
- Stream
  - Multiple Events
  - `stream.cancel()` to avoid Memory Leaks

---

### State Manager

- Buil-in
- Use a library
  - `Provider`
  - Makes it easier to use
