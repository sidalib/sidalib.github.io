#### 👷‍♂️ My progression

- ✅ Pitch
- ✅ Mockups
- ✅ Conception
- ❌ Develop that app !

---

### 🛠 Which tool should I use

- Platform Specific
- Cross Platform

---

### 👉 Platform Specific

- Android: Kotlin & Java
- iOS: Swift & SwiftUI

  I want to have two apps,
  then I must write one per platform ? 😭

---

## 🙅‍♂️ Nope

I don't have time to do that.
Let's find out a more pragmatic solution ! 💡

---

## And the answer is...

---

### 🪐 Cross Platform

- **Native**

  - Flutter
  - React Native

- **Hybrid**
  - Ionic

---

### 🤷‍♀️ Why a Cross platform framework

1 code = Android + iOS + Web 🎉

---

### So...

- No need to write multiple apps 📱
- It will cost less time and money ⏳💵

---

### Summary

React Native, Flutter, Ionic came to save us 🎉

- Single UI Team
- Less time coding
- Less time maintaining code
- Less monies spending

# ⚛️ React Native

---

## 🤷‍♀️ What is it

[React](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) lets you create native apps for:

- Android
- iOS
- Even Web

---

## 👷‍♂️ Who Created it

Facebook

---

## 💻 Who is using it

- Airbnb
- Tesla
- Facebook
- Instagram
- Wallmart
- Discord

---

### 👩‍🏫 The principle

"Learn once, write anywhere."

Instead of sharing the same codebase, you share the same principles

---

### 💥 Extend you tooling

Use [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/)

### 🤷‍♀️ What is Expo

- Framework and a platform for universal React applications
- Brings a set of tools built around React Native and native platforms
  - Helps you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate

---

### 🤷‍♀️ What is Expo

- Expo pushes to realize the “Write once, run anywhere” dream
- Avoid touching native code, just write React
- No need for configuration when using lower level APIs
- Gives an abstraction around specic platform behaviours

---

### 🧰 Setup

- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any other editor
- Create your app with [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v36.0.0/get-started/create-a-new-app/)
- You're ready to go!

```bash
expo init MyApp
```

---

### 🗂 Project Structure

- `node_modules/`: dependencies
- `assets/`: app icon, splash screen, images...
- `App.jsx`: entry point
- `app.json`: configuration
- `package.json`: dependencies listing, and more configs

---

### 🥋 React vs React Native

It's Web vs Native

---

## ⚛️ React

- **Style & Layout**: HTML, CSS
- **Logic**: JavaScript with React.js

---

## ⚛️📱 React Native

- **Style & Layout**: Native Platform mapped to their target platform equivalent
  - View: Android `View` & iOS `UIView`
  - Text: Android `TextView` & iOS `UITextField`
  - ...
- **Logic**: JavaScript with React.js

---

### 💅 Layout & Style

- [Style](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/react-native/style/)
- Layout with [CSS Flexbox](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/react-native/flexbox/)
  - Columns
  - Rows

---

### 📱 Layout

Everything is a Component

- [Icons](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v36.0.0/guides/icons/)
- [Handling TextInput](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/react-native/handling-text-input/)
- [Handling Touches](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/react-native/handling-touches/)
- [ScrollView](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/react-native/using-a-scrollview/)
- [ListView](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/react-native/using-a-listview/)
- [Networking](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/react-native/network/)
- [Navigation with React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/): third party library

---

### ✅ The Goods (part 1)

- Target multiple platforms
- Single code base
  - Develop the app once
- Deploy it
  - Google Playstore (Android)
  - Apple Store (iOS)
  - Target the Web (but it’s in Alpha)

---

## ✅ The Goods (part 2)

- JS Programming Language
  - Very approachable
  - C style language
- Built-in Components
  - Fast prototyping
  - Rapid iteration
- The community
  - Huge community
  - Many problems already solved by somebody

---

### In Brief

- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) lets you build Android and iOS with one Code Base,
- [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/) makes it easier to work with React Native

<!-- Flutter BEGIN-->

---

# 🐦 Flutter

---

## 🤷‍♀️ What is it

- Flutter lets develop applications for Android and iOS
- It's primary method of creating applications for Google Fuchsia.

---

## 👷‍♂️ Who Created it

Google

---

## 👷‍♂️ Who is using it

- Google Assistant
- Google Ads
- Alibaba Group
- The New York Times
- Square

---

## 👩‍🏫 The principle

Same as React Native, write once run anywhere.

---

### ✅ The Goods (part 1)

#### ⌨️ Developer Experience (part 1)

- `Dart` programming language
  - Very approachable
  - `C` style language
  - Amazing developer tooling
  - Inline documentation
  - Catch errors before running the app

---

#### ⌨️ Developer Experience (part 2)

- Built-in Widgets
  - Fast prototyping
  - Rapid iteration
  - Not so many third party dependencies

---

### ✅ The Goods (part 2)

#### 🏎 Performance

- `60 FPS` to `120 FPS` Rendering
- Implements it’s own `C++` Engine
  - With the `Skia` Library
  - Gives a blanks canvas to render your own graphics, like a game engine
- Compilation
  - **Just in Time**: Good debugging
  - **Ahead of Time**: Performant

---

### ❌ The Tradeofs

- Small ecosystem
  - But, grows really fast 🚀
  - Difficult to find the right packages for your need
- Not all Specific platform APIs supported
  - Don’t use it if you have a lot of low level features to handle

---

### 🧰 Setup

Follow the steps [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

- Download Flutter, and extract it where you want
- Add it to environment path in order to access the `flutter` command anywhere
- Run `flutter doctor`
- Your first project

  - In your terminal:

  ```bash
  flutter create AppName
  ```

---

### ⌨️ VSCode Extensions

- Dart
- Flutter
- Awesome Flutter Snippets
- Android iOS Emulator
  - Makes it easier to switch between Emulated and Plugged In devices

---

### 🗂 Project Structure

- `android/` & `ios/`: Platfrom specific configuration
- `lib/`: your widgets
- `pubspec.yml`:
  - like `package.json` in the JS ecosystem
  - registers static assets(images, etc...), included in the final bundle of the app

---

### 🟢 Run you App

- Create a Virtual Device in **Android Studio** or plug yours
- Run it in **VSCode**: hit `F5` and here you go
- It will **Hot reload** on your changes
  - State of the app is preserved

---

### ⌨️ Everything is a Widget

Most of the widgets have at least one name argument.

- Just hover between paratheses to see what you can do it
  - Awesome `tab` programming

---

### ⌨️ Widgets: Stateful vs Stateless

---

### Stateful Widget

- [Interactive](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/interactive)
- Has in internal State than can be altered
  - **setState** to change it
- Has Lifecycle
  - **initState()**: called when added to the app tree
  - **dispose()**: called when removed from the Widgets tree
- Implementation
  - State Class
  - Layout Class that extends the State Class

---

### Stateless Widget

- Immutable

  - No dynamic internal State
  - Lot of built-in mechanism to trigger UI reloads
  - Properties defined inside will never change

- Implementation

  - Implement a `build` Method, give it a `context` to say where it lives in the Widgets Tree

- Properties are defined inside the constructor
  - `key` is used to let flutter know the order and stuff

---

### 💅 Themes

- [Material](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets/material)

  - Google : `import 'package:flutter/material.dart';`

- [Cupertino](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets/cupertino)

  - Apple: `import 'package:flutter/cupertino.dart';`

---

### 📱 Platform Specific

- `import 'dart:io' show Platform`;
- To determine the environment on which you're in
  - Display based on that manually

---

### 📱 Layout

- [Built-In](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/layout)
  - Center
  - Padding
  - Container: does multiple things at same time
  - And more...

---

### 📱 Layout: Box Decoration

- [Box Decoration](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/BoxDecoration-class.html) is for applying styles
  - Shadows
  - Gradients
  - Change the shape of a `Container` for example

---

### 📱 Layout: Text

- [Text](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/TextStyle-class.html)
- Style
  - TextStyle
  - Can use `Theme.of` to use theme of context
- Handle if text is too long and stuff

---

### 📱 Layout: Gestures and Buttons

- Interactions

  - [Buttons](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets/material#Buttons)
  - A lot of built-in Buttons utilities

---

### 📱 Layout: Flex Layout

- Exactly like [CSS Flexbox](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/layout)
  - Columns
  - Rows

---

### 📱 Layout: Scrollable Views

- [ListView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ListView-class.html)
  - ListView.build: for larger set of data
- [GridView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GridView-class.html)
  - GrivView.count
  - Columns splitting

---

### 🛣 Navigation

- [Here](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/navigation/named-routes) is the principle
- Stack based
  - Push: forward
  - Pop: backward
- Use Navigator Class
- Can also use `PageView`, which is easier

---

### ⌨️ Forms

- [Form](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/forms/validation)
- [TextFormField](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TextFormField-class.html)

---

### ⏭ Async Widget

- [Future](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FutureBuilder-class.html)
  - One Event
- [Stream](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StreamBuilder-class.html)
  - Multiple Events
  - `stream.cancel()` to avoid Memory Leaks

---

### State Manager

- [Start thinking reactively](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/intro)
- Can use a library
  - [Provider](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple)
