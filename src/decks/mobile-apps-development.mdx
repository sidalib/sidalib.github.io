## 🧰 Which SDK should I use

---

### 🧰 Which SDK should I use

- Platform Specific
- Cross Platform

---

## 👉 Platform Specific

---

### 👉 Platform Specific

- Android: Kotlin & Java
- iOS: Swift & SwiftUI

I need to write code to have an Android and an iOS app ?

---

## 🙅‍♂️ Nope

I don't have time to do that.

---

## And the solution is...

---

## 🪐 Cross Platform

---

### 🪐 Cross Platform

- Hybrid:

  - Ionic

- Native:

  - Flutter
  - React Native

---

#### 🤷‍♀️ Why a Cross platform framework

1 code = Android + iOS + Web

🎉

---

## So...

---

- I don't need to write multiple apps 📱
- It will cost much less time and money ⏳💵

---

## Summary

---

### Summary

React Native, Flutter, Ionic ...etc... came to save us 🎉.

- Single UI Team
- Less time coding
- Less time maintaining code
- Less monies spending

    Introduction

## 🤷‍♀️ What is it

---

## 👷‍♂️ Who Created it

Facebook

---

## 👷‍♂️ Who is using it

- Airbnb
- Tesla
- Facebook
- Instagram
- Wallmart
- Discord

---

## 👩‍🏫 The principle

---

### 👩‍🏫 The principle

"Learn once, write anywhere."

Instead of sharing the same codebase, you share the same principles

---

## 💥 Extend you tooling

---

### 💥 Extend you tooling

Use [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/)

## 🤷‍♀️ What is Expo

---

### 🤷‍♀️ What is Expo

Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications.
It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.

---

### 🤷‍♀️ What is Expo

- Expo came to save us it’s evolving to support the “Write once, run anywhere”
- Avoid touching any native code Just write React
- I wan’t to add Geoloc and stuff Need to deal with native platforms Android Studion XCdode
- It gives an abstraction around specic platform behaviours

React Native Team & Expo Team are Very close💞

---

## 🧰 Configuration

---

### 🧰 Configuration

- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any other editor, but trust me, VSCode is dope ! 💪
- Create an App with [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v36.0.0/get-started/create-a-new-app/)
- You're ready to go!

---

## 🗂 Project Structure

---

### 🗂 Project Structure

- `node_modules/`: all dependecies reside here
- `assets/`: app icon, splash screen, images, fonts
- `App.jsx`: app entry point
- `app.json`: app configuration, no need to deal with Android Studio and XCode to edit configs 🎉
- `package.json`: dependencies, and other configs

---

## 🥋 React vs React Native

---

### 🥋 React vs React Native

It's Web vs Native

---

## ⚛️ React

- Style & Layout: HTML, CSS
- Logic: JavaScript with React.js

---

## ⚛️📱 React Native

- Style & Layout: Native Platform mapped to their target platform equivalent
  - View: Android `View` & iOS `UIView`
  - Text: Android `TextView` & iOS `UITextField`
  - ...
- Logic: JavaScript with React.js

---

## 💅 Style & Layout

---

### 💅 Style

- CSS Flexbox like syntax
  - Columns
  - Rows

### 📱 Layout

Everything is a Component

- (Icons](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v36.0.0/guides/icons/)
- Handling TextInput
- Handling Touches
- ScrollView
- ListView
- Networking
- Navigation: third Party: https://reactnavigation.org/

---

## ✅ What is good

---

### ✅ What is good

- Target multiple platforms
- Single code base
  - Develop the app once
- Deploy it
  - Google Playstore (Android) - Apple Store (iOS) - Target the Web (but it’s in Alpha)

---

## ✅ What is good

- JS Programming Language
  - Very approachable - C style language
- Built-in Components - Fast prototyping - Rapid iteration - Not so many third party dependencies
- The community - Huge community - Almost all your problems are already solved

---

## 1️⃣ In one sentence

---

React Native lets you build Android and iOS with one Code Base, and Expo makes it easier to work with React Native.
